          'Bengals are a hybrid cat breed. In the early 1900s, breeders crossed domestic felines with Asian ' +
          'leopard cats, a small, wild species native to Southeast Asia. Asian leopard cats — also known as Felis ' +
          'bengalensis, which is where “Bengal” comes from — are known for having a slender build and wild appearance.',

          'While the breed crossings began more than 120 years ago, the actual Bengal species wasn\'t established until ' +
          'the 1970s when Jean Sugden Mill bred the Asian leopard cat hybrids with domestic cat breeds. Her goal was ' +
          'to produce a breed that stayed true to the exotic appearance of the Asian leopard cat, with the personality ' +
          'of a domestic house cat.'

          'with children, other cats, and with family dogs. The key, however, is early socialization and exposure to ' +
          'household members at a young age. If you try to introduce a new pet to older Bengals already set in their ' +
          'ways, you might have a challenge on your hands.',

          'Because Bengals are an intelligent and curious breed, they need constant stimulation to keep their big brains ' +
          'engaged. They love playing with toys and are also known to love water and enjoy a shallow tub. Bengals can be' +
